"                chapter  the creature in the shop   my name is dr frederick treves i am a doctor at the london hospital one day in , i saw a picture in the window of a shop near the hospital i stopped in front of the shop and looked at the picture at first i felt interested, then i felt angry, then afraid it was a horrible, ugly picture there was a man in the picture, but he did not look like you and me he did not look like a man he looked like an elephant i read the writing under the picture it said come in and see the elephant man  pence i opened the door and went in there was a man in the shop he was a dirty man in an old coat with a cigarette in his mouth what do you wanthe asked id like to see the elephant man, please, i said the man looked at me angrily well, you cant,  he said the shops closing now you can come back tomorrow  im sorry, i said  but i would like to see him now i have no time tomorrowi have a lot of work to do but i can give you more than  pence  the man looked at me carefully then he took the cigarette out of his mouth and smiled with his yellow teeth all right, sir, he said give me twelve pence then  i gave him the money and he opened a door at the back of the shop we went into a little room the room was cold and dark, and there was a horrible smell in it a creature sat on a chair behind a table i say a creature, because it was not a man or a woman, like you or me the creature did not move or look at us it sat very quietly on the chair in the cold, dark, dirty room, and looked at the table the creature had a cloth over its head, because of the cold on the table in front of it, there was a dead flower stand up said the shopkeeper, loudly the creature stood up slowly it took the old cloth off its head, and put it on the chair i looked at the creature and felt sad i am a doctor, so i know a lot about accidents and ill people i see horrible, ugly things every day but this creature, this thing, was the worst of all there were no men or women in the hospital like him he wore some old trousers, but no shirt, coat, or shoes, so i could see his body very well his head was the most interesting thing it was very, very biglike an enormous bag with a lot of books in it the head did not have much hair, and there was another bag of brown, dirty skin at the back of it this skin came down below his neck i could not see one of his eyes very well, because a lot of skin came down in front of his face, too an enormous red tooth came out of his mouth, under his nose it looked like an elephants tooth the mouth and nose were like holes in the face the face could not smile or laugh or look angry or sad, because the skin could not move it was dead, like an elephants face there were more bags of dirty skin on the front and back of the creatures body these bags came down to his legs the right arm was enormous, and there were bags of skin on it, too the right hand was like a mans foot but the left hand the left arm and the left hand were beautiful the left arm had wonderful skin, and the fingers of the left hand were long and beautiful it was like a young womans hand walk, merrick  said the shopkeeper angrily come on, quickly, move he hit the creature with his hand slowly, the creature walked across the room but he could not walk well his legs were very big and fat, and he had a bad back he could not walk far without a stick all right, thank you, i said let him sit down i dont want to see any more i felt ill, and the smell in the room was very bad yes, sir, said the shopkeeper sit down, merrick  we went out of the room and closed the door the shopkeeper smiled at me with his yellow teeth wonderful, sir, isnt ithe said the best elephant man in england hundreds of people come to see him, you know, hundreds i take

can take him to the hospital in a cab                                                  chapter  the card   so next day, at seven oclock, i came to the shop in a cab there were not very many people in the road, because it was early in the morning in november it is dark at seven oclock in the morning, and i could not see the shop very well i waited five minutes a postman walked past then the door of the shop opened, and the creature, merrick , came out i could not see his face or his body he had an enormous black hat on his head, like a big box a grey cloth came down from the hat, in front of his face there was a hole in the cloth in front of his eyes he could see out of the hole but i could not see in he wore a long black coat, too the coat began at his neck, and ended at his feet, so i could not see his arms, his body, or his legs on his feet he wore big shoes, like old bags he had a stick in his left hand, and he walked very slowly i opened the door of the cab, and got out good morning, mr merrick, i said can you get in elpmyupasteps, he said im sorry, i said i dont understand  for a minute he stood by the door of the cab and said nothing then he hit the cab with his stick steps he said loudly help me up the steps  then i understood there were three steps up into the cab, and he could not get up them yes, i see im sorry, i said let me help you  i took his left hand and began to help him my right hand was behind his back i felt very strange his left hand was like a young womans, but his back under the coat, was horrible i could feel the bags of old skin on his back under the coat he put one enormous foot on the first step, and then he stopped after a minute, he moved his second foot slowly then he stopped and waited again hello, sir can i help you i looked behind me it was the postman and behind him, i could see three young boys one of the boys laughed the postman smiled is the gentleman illhe asked i thought quickly yes but this is a lady, not a gentleman im a doctor, and shes ill take her hand, so i can help her better  the postman took merricks left hand, and i helped him with two hands from behind slowly, very slowly, merrick went up the steps and into the cab one boy was very near the cab he called to his friends come and see this, boys a fat lady in a black coat and look at that enormous hat  the boys laughed they were very near the cab too, now i closed the door quickly thank you, i said to the postman thats all right, sir, he said shes a strange lady, sir, isnt she shes ill, thats all, i said quickly were going to the hospital goodbye, and thank you  the cab drove down the road to the hospital i locked at merrick that was difficult, wasnt iti said at first he said nothing, but then he spoke his voice was very strange, but i listened to him carefully, and i could understand him the steps were very difficult, he said but most things are difficult for me  yes, i said  nothing is easy for you, is it no, he said he was very quiet for a minute then he said, who are you, sir who am ioh, im sorry, my name is dr treves here, this is my card  i gave him a card with my name on then i thought, that was no good this man cant read but merrick took the card and looked at it very carefully then he put it in his trousers pocket i did not talk to him very much at the hospital i looked at his head and arms and legs and body very carefully then i wrote the important things about him in a little book a nurse helped me merrick looked at her sometimes, but she did not smile at him or talk to him i think she was afraid of him i think merrick was afraid too, because he was very quiet at four oclock i took him back to the shop in a cab the next day i looked in the shop window again, but the picture was not there          elpmyupasteps                          chapter  a letter tothe times   i did not see merrick again for two years then, one day, the police found him he had my card in his hand, so they brought him to the london hospital he was very tired, hungry, and dirty, so i put him to bed in a quiet little room but he could not stay at the hospital he was not ill, and of course the beds in the hospital are for ill people we have no beds for hungry people, or ugly people i told the hospital chairman, mr cars gomm, about merrick he listened carefully, and then he wrote a letter to the editor of the times newspaper  from the times, december th,  a letter to the editor  dear sir, i am writing to you about a man in our hospital he needs your help his name is joseph merrick, and he is  years old he is not ill, but he cannot go out of the hospital because he is very, very ugly nobody likes to look at him, and some people are afraid him we call him the elephant man two years ago, merrick lived in a shop near the london hospital for two pence, people could see him and laugh at him one day dr frederick trevesa hospital doctorsawmerrick, brought him to this hospital, and looked at him carefully dr treves could not help merrick, but he gave him his card then the shopkeeper, silcock, took merrick to belgium a lot of people in belgium wanted to see him, and so after a year merrick had  but then silcock took merricks , left merrick in belgium, and went back to london merrick came back to london by himself everyone on the train and the ship looked at him, and laughed at him in london, the police put him in prison but then they saw drtrevess card, and brought merrick to the london hospital this man has no money, and he cannot work his face and body are very, very ugly, so of course many people are afraid of him but he is a very interesting man he can read and write, and he thinks a lot he is a good, quiet man sometimes he makes things with his hands and gives them to the nurses, because they are kind to him he remembers his mother, and he has a picture of her she was beautiful and kind, he says but he never sees her now she gave him to silcock a long time ago can the readers of the times help us this man is not ill, but he needs a home we can give him a room at the hospital, but we need some money please write to me at the london hospital  yours faithfully, f c carr gomm chairman of the london hospital  the readers of the times are very kind people they gave us a lot of money after one week, we had , , so merrick could live in the hospital for all his life we could give him a home                        fc         chapter  merricks first home   we gave merrick two rooms at the back of the hospital one room was a bathroom, so he could have a bath every day soon his skin was much better, and there was no horrible smell the second room had a bed, table , and chairs i visited him every day, and talked to him he loved reading, and talking about books at first he did not know many booksthe bible, and one or two newspapers, thats all but i gave him some books of love stories, and he liked them very much he read them again and again, and talked about them often for him, the men and women in these books were alive, like you and me he was very happy but sometimes it was difficult for him at first, one or two people in the hospital laughed at merrick because he was ugly sometimes, they brought their friends to look at him one day a new nurse came to the hospital, and nobody told her about merrick she took his food to his room, and opened the door then she saw him she screamed, dropped the food on the floor, and ran out of the room i was very angry with the nurse, and went to see merrick he was not happy about it, but he was not very angry i think he felt sorry for the girl people dont like looking at me i know that, dr treves, he said they usually laugh or scream  well, i dont want nurses to laugh at you, joseph,  i said angrily i want them to help you  thank you, doctor, he said, in his strange slow voice but its not important everyone laughs at me i understand that  i looked at him sadly in his one good hand, his left hand, he had the little picture of his mother he looked at the picture for a minute, and then put it by a flower on the table a tear ran out of his eye and down the skin of his enormous, ugly face dr treves, he said, slowly you and the nurses arevery kind, and im very happy here thank you very much buti know i cant stay here long, andi would like to live in a lighthouse, after the hospital, please a lighthouse, or a home for blind people i think those are the best places for me what do you meani ashed why he did not look at me he put the flower on the picture and looked at it carefully lighthouses have sea all round them, dont they he said  nobody could look at me in a lighthouse, so i would be happy there and blind people can see nothing, so they couldnt see me, could they but joseph, i said this is your home you live here now you arent going to leave the hospital  not todsy, perhaps, he said but soon you are a kind man, dr treves but i cant stay here very long i have no money  i smiled joseph, i said this is your home now dont you understandyou can stay here all your life  very carefully, i told him about the letter to the times, and the money i dont think he understood at first, so i told him again he was very quiet for a minute then he stood up, and walked up and down the room very quickly a strange sound came from him, like laughing                    chapter  an important visitor   i did not want merrick to live by himself, like a man in a lighthouse he read his books, and talked to me, but i wanted him to talk to more people and i wanted him to talk to women merrick read about women in his books, but he did not often talk to women he met the nurses every day, but they did not talk to him very much for them, he was always a creature, not a man one day, one of my friends, a beautiful young woman, came to the hospital i told her about merrick, and took her to his room she opened the door, and smiled at him good morning, mr merrick, she said then she shook his hand merrick looked at her for a minute with his mouth open then he sat down on his bed, with his head in his hand, and cried he cried for nearly five minutes the tears ran down his face, between his fingers, and onto the floor my friend sat on the bed beside him and put her hand on his arm she said nothing, but she smiled at him and shookhis hand again before she left dr treves, he said to me that night that lady was wonderful my mother smiled at me once, many years ago, but no women smile at me now but this lady smiled at me too, and she shook my hand a beautiful lady smiled at me and shook my hand  my young lady friend came again the next week, and talked to merrick for half an hour the week after that, she came again with a friend they gave him some books, and had a cup of tea with him it was wonderful for him for the first time in his life, he had some friends he was a very happy man he sat in his room, and read his books, and said no more about living on a lighthouse people began to read about merrick in the newspapers, sohe had a lot of visitors everybody wanted to see him a lot of important ladies and gentlemen visited him they smiled at him, shook his hand, and gave him books merrick liked talking to these people, and he began to forget about his uglybody his visitors never laughed at him he began to feel like a man, not a creature one wonderful day, a very important lady came to the hospital to visit him i met the lady, and took her to his room then i opened the door, and smiled at him good morning, joseph, i said there is a new visitor to see you today a very famous lady  merrick stood up beside his table he did not smile, because his face could not smile, but his eyes looked happy thats good, he said who is it i moved away from the door, and the visitor walked in your majesty, this is joseph merrick, i said joseph, this is her majesty, queen alexandra, the queen of england  queen alexandra smiled at him how do you do, mr merrick, she said im very pleased to meet you then she shook his hand merrick did not move for nearly half a minute he stood and looked at her with his mouth open then he spoke, in his strange, slow voice how how do you do, your majesty, he said but i dont think the queen understood him, because he tried to get down on his knees at the same time it was very difficult for him, because of his enormous legs no, please, mr merrick, do get up, said the queen i would like to talk to you can we sit at your table yesyes, of course, he said they sat at the table she took his left hand, the good hand, in hers she looked at the hand carefully, and then smiled at merrick again i often read about you in the newspapers, she said you are a very interesting man, mr merrick you have a very difficult life, but people say youre happy is it true are you happy now oh, yes, your majesty, yes said merrick im a very happy man i have a home here now, and friends, and my books im happy every hour of the day  what a wonderful story she said

books the queen gave him a little book, and some red flowers, before she left after her visit, merrick began to sing he could not sing easily, of course, because of his mouth, but all that day there was a strange, happy noise in his room he looked at the flowers carefully, and put them on his table he had many visits from the queen, and at christmas she sent him a christmas card  windsor castle

friends now, but he was more like a child than a man he could read about things, and talk to his visitors, but he could not go out of the hospital by himself he thought and played like a child after christmas, he wanted to go to the theatre this was very difficult, because i did not want the people in the theatre to see him but a kind lady from the theatremrs kendalhelped us we bought tickets for a box at the side of the theatre we went to the theatre in a cab with dark windows, and we went into the theatre by a door at the backthe queens door nobody saw us three nurses sat at the front of the box, and merrick and i sat in the dark behind them nobody in the theatre could see us, but we could see the play it was a childrens christmas play merrick loved it it was a most wonderful, exciting story often he laughed, and sometimes he tried to sing like the children in the theatre he was like a child for him, everything in the story was true once he was very afraid, because the bad man in the play was angry and had a knife at first merrick wanted to leave the theatre, but i stopped him then he was very angry with this bad man in the play he hit his hand on his chair, and stood up and talked to the man but nobody heard him when the bad man went to prison, merrick laughed merrick thought the beautiful young lady in the play was wonderful he wanted to talk to her too at the end of the play he was very happy because she married a good young man he remembered this play for a long time, and he talked a lot about the people in it what do you think they did after we lefthe asked me where do the young lady and the young man live what are they doing now i dont know, i said perhaps they live in the country  merrick thought about this for a long time then he saiddr treves, can i go to the country, pleasei saw the country once from a train, but i never went there i often read about it in books its very beautiful, isnt iti would like to see it  the visit to the theatre was difficult but a visit to the country was more difficult but again, one of his new friends helped us she had a small house in the country, and merrick could stay in it for the summer, she said i took merrick to the country in a train with dark windows, so nobody could see him then we went in a cab to the country house there were a lot of trees near the house, but no people lived near it a countryman brought food to the house everyday, but no people came near it i stayed with him that night at night, it was very dark and quiet in the morning, hundreds of birds sang in the trees, and everything outside the house was green merrick walked under the big trees, looking at things happily, and singing his strange song i went back to london, but merrick stayed there for six weeks he was wonderfully happy every week, he wrote me a letter  apple tree house, west wickham, berkshire st july   dear dr treves, i had a wonderful day again today, it was very warm, so i walked under the trees and sat by a stream the water in the stream made a beautiful noise, like singing did you know thati listened to it for two hours lots of little birds came near me  one had a red body in front, and a brown back i gave it some bread, and it sat on my hand a lot of birds are my friends, now i watched the fish in the stream, too they were very exciting, because they move very fast one minute they were there, and the next minute i couldnt see them but i waited quietly, and they always came back i put my hand in the water, but i couldnt touch them i met a big dog yesterday it made a very loud noise, but i was not afraid i sat down quietly and looked it, and it came and smelt my hand i saw it again today, and gave it some bread it likes me now i am going to put some flowers from the country
