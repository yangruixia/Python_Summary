die i want to write the true story of my life for you everything that i write here is truei cannot lie to you or to god please believe that james its impor tant to me my father died when i was one week old so i was the queen of scots when i was a baby at first i lived with my mother in scotland and then when i was five i went to france my mother was french but she stayed in scotland and died there i went to france to marry the king of frances son his name was francis and he was one year younger than me in  his father died so francis was king then i was queen of france and queen of scotland too i was very happy in france francis my husband was like a little brother to me i think he loved me bur he was very youngand he was often illand thenin he diedhe was sixteen years old when he died i was very unhappy and my life was very different there was a new king and queen and i wasnt important in france any more but i was still queen of scots so i came back to scotland when i arrived in scotland i was a young girl of eighteen my mother was dead and there was no one there to meet me i walked off the shipand i slept in a little house near the sea next day the scots lords came from edinburgh they were pleased to see me and for a week everyone was happy people smiled at me and sang in the streets i think everyone liked me then that sunday i went to church james my son you are a protestant and i am a catholicyou are a good man and you love god but your church and my church are enemies i was born a catholic and i am going to die a catholic i love god tooi hope you understand that im not going to change now that sunday people shouted angrily in the streetsyour majestysaid the scots lordsscotland is a protestant country you cant go to a catholic church here the scottish people dont like catholics  im sorry my lordsi saidbut i am your queenno one tells me what to doi dont hate protestantsand im not going to kill them the people can go to their protestant churches and pray to god there but im going to pray with catholics in my church people were angry because of that a man called john knox came to see me he was a famous protestant churchman but i didnt like him he was a big angry man with black clotheshe hated the catholic church and wanted all catholics to leave scotland to him the protestant church was the only true church of god he saidyour majesty youre a young woman like my daughter women cant understand difficult things like god or the church find a good protestant husbandgirl let him rule this country for you i was very angry with this man knox i was a queen but i was only eighteen he didnt talk quietlyhe shouted at mei cried because of his angry words i could not understand himhe talked so much and he knew so many books but i did not go to his church he was right about one thing perhaps i could rule scotland without a man but i could not have a child without one and every queen needs a son or daughter to come after herso i began to look for a husband                         darnley and riccio   at first i wanted to marry the son of the king of spaindon carlos but he was a catholic of course and my scots lords did not like that it was difficult for me james i wanted to please myself i wanted to please my friends and family in france and to please my people too and then there was the queen of england at first i wanted very much to be friends with elizabethwe wrote many letters and talked about a meetinga meeting between two sister queenselizabeth wrote to me at this time our two countries need to be friendsyou need a husbandi need a friendwhy not marry my friend robert dudleythe earl of leicesterhe is a tallstrong man i think he could be a good husband for you i was very angry about this letterthere were a lot of stories about elizabeth and robert dudleythey were good friendshe often danced and sang and talked with her sometimespeople said he stayed in her room all night dudley had a wife but one day she died very suddenly it was an accidentshe fell down the stairs they say but then perhaps she was unhappy because of her husband and elizabeth and she writes to me about a man like thisi thoughtshe wants him to marry me because he is her friendher loverperhapsshe wants her lover to be king of scotland i found a better man than dudley james i found henry darnley your father he was nineteen years old and i was twentythreehe was a tall man with a beautiful face and big green eyes he talked and sang well and i liked dancing with him he often wore expensive black clothes and he laughed a lot when he was with me he was very young and friendly and i felt happy when i was with him i liked him very much and i thought he loved me too he was an important man toowe were cousinshis grandfather was king of scots and his greatgrandfather was henry vii of england in july  i married him elizabeth was very angry and so were a lot of the scots lords my halfbrother the earl of moray tried to stop the marriage i had to fight him and he ran south to englandbut i was happyyour father and i laughed every day he was now henry king of scots after one or two weeks the laughter stopped a king has a lot of work james you know that he has to read hundreds of letters talk to people and think about a lot of important thingsi did those thingsevery daybut nowi thoughti had a man to help me my lord henryi saidwould you like to read all the letters with me you can sit next to me and you can work with me every day your father looked unhappyim not interested in work like thathe saidi dont

they drank a lot and laughed and sang and there were often fights but no one said anythingbecause he was the king my husband what could people say they were unhappy but they were afraid of him some of them went to england to the earl of moray at this time i was often very tired because i was pregnantyou my son james were alive inside me but i did all the work of a queen and i needed friends tooone of these friends was a young italian david riccio riccio was a little man and he was not tall or beautiful or strong but he was a very clever interesting man he wrote many of my letters for me and helped me he sang well tooand i sometimes sang with him in the evenings i liked him very muchand at firstyour father liked him too but then morays friends began to talk about me and ricciodavid riccio is in the queens rooms every nightthey said to your fathershe laughs and sings and dances with him my lordit is not right he is not a scotsman and he is not her husband he is always with her perhaps
